## Infosheet: social media muting, blocking, and unfollowing

If you are receiving unwanted comments or harassment from other users on a social media site, you can typically do one of the following three:

1. **Mute**: If you mute another user, they will typically still be able to see your content and comment on it, you will just not be notified when they do so. The user who has been muted will not be notified, either. They might continue posting the content without realising that you are no longer notified when that happens.
2. **Block**: If you block another user, they will not be able to see your account or any content you post. If the blocked user searches for you, they will be able to find out that they were blocked.
3. **Remove follower**: This option is only available on some social media services. It allows you to silently remove a follower. That removed account will no longer see your posts in their feed, but is able to re-follow you at any time. Social media sites do not typically notify people when they have been removed as a follower.

Different methods can work at different times. In some cases, it might be better to mute or remove a follower rather than blocking them outright. This is because harassers who have been blocked might be alerted to the fact that the harassment is working, and create new accounts with which to make unwanted comments. At other times, blocking might be a much better way of maintaining peace of mind and keeping unwanted comments off your account.

Safety settings vary between social media platforms. To see which safety features are available, check the site's documentation. Different sites might also use different terms to describe similar features. In some cases, the functionality of safety features can also change. X (formerly known as Twitter), for example, recently modified [the way blocking works](https://help.x.com/en/using-x/blocking-and-unblocking-accounts). Users you blocked can now see your public posts, even if they still aren't able to follow you or engage with your posts.
