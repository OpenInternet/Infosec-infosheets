# Infosec infosheets

Internews staff and partners developed a series of infosheets which we use to support trainings and supplement existing training materials. They are available under the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, so feel free to adapt and use them in your own trainings!

If you have any suggestions or improvements, we would be delighted if you could file an issue or pull request!

## Credits

We would like to thank the following people (in no particular order) for authoring, proofreading, iterating upon, and publishing the infosheets
