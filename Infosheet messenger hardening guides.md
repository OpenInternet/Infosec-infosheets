## Enable two-step verification/ two-factor authentication

As we mentioned in our guide on [messenger takeovers](Infosheet messenger takeover attacks.md), someone who manages to intercept SMS messages sent to your account--or tricks you into sending them a six-digit code--will be able to take over your WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram account. Fortunately, it's easy to set an additional password without which you cannot register the account on a new device. We strongly encourage enabling this feature.

### How to enable this feature

[WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1278661612895630)
[Signal](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN#manage_registration_lock) (enable PIN and registration lock)
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/blog/sessions-and-2-step-verification)



## Disappearing messages

You can enable disappearing messages on your chats. Once you do so, messages will be automatically removed from your devices as well as those of your interlocutors. Disappearing messages work on a timer (for example, they might automatically get wiped after 24 hours or a week). This reduces the chances that message contents will be leaked if, for example, a device was lost or stolen while unlocked or broken into.

In Signal, the timer begins on the sender's device when the message is sent and on the recipient's device when the message is opened. In WhatsApp, the timer begins on both the sender's and recipient's devices after the message is sent.

Telegram _only_ supports automatic disappearing messages on secret chats, not standard chats or groupchats.
