This is a fully text-based description of the *successful phishing attack* infographic.

This infographic describes a successful phishing attack involving an authenticator app, SMS code, or a code sent by email. None of those are phishing-resistant forms of two-factor authentication, in contrast to physical security keys.

The graphic looks at three levels: what the user is doing, what the phishing website is doing, and what the adversary does.

On the first step, the user accidentally visits a phishing website and enters their username and password.

The graphic jumps to the second step, illustrating how, after receiving the password, thephishing site asks the user to enter their username and password

In the third step, we get back to the user level. The user enters the code from their authenticator app (or one they received via SMS or email) into the phishing site

Step four shows how the adversary behind the phishing site will copy both the password and the phishing code they received from the user. In step five, the adversary copies both the code and the password into the real website.

Step six starts with heavily emphasized text which exclaims **Phishing Attempt is Successful**. It goes on to explain that the real website now shares its content with the adversary, and the adversary has full access to the site as if they were a normal user.

Finally, step seven explains that the user might still be able to access thereal website and doesnâ€™t necessarily know that the adversary can also see its content
